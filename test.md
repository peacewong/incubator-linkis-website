    I nominate Chen Xia as an Linkis Committer candidate
 
    Judging from the contributions in recent months, Chen Xia has submitted many implementations[1],[2] to the project. His has done a lot of work  for the infrastructure of the official website[3]. And interaction via email[4]. During the optimization and improvement period of the project, it is hoped that more people will participate in the actual project optimization and improvement, to let the project more perfect and easier to use.
 
    So I nominated Chen Xia as Committer of the Linkis project.
