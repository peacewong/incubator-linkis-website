## New Features

- Linkis's RPC function supports automatic retries
- Introduction of Spring boot Admin module for monitoring and managing Linkis services
- EC supports setting the status to unhealthy and automatically exiting when idle
- Added support for SparkMeasure in the Spark engine for better monitoring of Spark performance
- Added containerized mode in the ECM service, allowing specific IPs and ports for communication with the outside world to be assigned to specific engines in this mode

## Enhancements

- The management console actively kills corresponding idle engines after modifying the configuration, allowing parameters to take effect immediately
- Support for users to specify a fixed engine instance for execution in scripts
- Addition of system-built-in date variables, supporting run_today_h, etc.
- Front-end global history adds the ability to view running code
- The data source service adds an interface to return Hive libraries with write permissions under the user
- Public enhancement service operations on HDFS support using the administrator's FS
- Public enhancement service adds an interface to query the MD5 value of the result set file
- Linkis Manager engine Ask increases delayed scheduling to prevent excessive concurrent requests to the engine
- Tasks in the queue support timed printing of queue information to help confirm if the task is abnormally hanging
- Optimization of log printing when resources are insufficient, specifying the exact parameters users need to modify
- Engine reuse optimization, intelligently judging the resource parameters carried by the current task to avoid complex tasks reusing small resources
- Historical tasks set departmental administrator permissions only support viewing historical tasks submitted by personnel in their own department
- The front-end global history page supports filtering jobs by ECM machine
- The front-end resource panel page categorizes support for displaying by application
- User result set display optimization limits the number of display columns
- Result set error message optimization when a field exceeds 1w
- Pipeline CSV file export parameter configuration adds vertical bar, semicolon separators
- Engine instances add task ID tags for driver engine startup
- Support for passing task source information to Yarn layer labels
- Linkis client SDK query Hive data returns results adapted to Map, Array, Struct complex data types
- Front-end management console ECM table adds a remark field
- Front-end historical task interface optimization supports time range queries accurate to minutes
- Hive task log printing displays Yarn's application address information
- The view log interface openLog adds a file size limit of 30M
- A new interface is added to determine if the resources for the executing task are sufficient
- LinkisManager engine application is adjusted to asynchronous mode, which can significantly improve the concurrency of engine application
- Linkis management console supports engine log download function
- Trino engine task log printing cluster URL, including Trino's queryId in linkis's taskid
- Public enhancement service file operations support file directory moving
- Engine task log proactive push adds a record of user-initiated kill operations in the task log after the user actively kills the engine

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the display issue of engine remaining resource data on the resource management page
- Fixed the occasional ThreadDeath issue in Spark engine tasks
- Optimized the error message提示 for abnormal data query in pyspark scripts
- The engine log entry function is only open to administrators
- Fixed the OOM issue caused by excessive single-line data in the result set
- Fixed the error in the status transition of tasks when canceling Spark Scala tasks
- Fixed the occasional error "Failed to create a single-machine Python interpreter" when reusing engines after canceling Python tasks
- Optimized the FullGC issue that may occur when the number of HDFS file users is too large
- Fixed the type conversion error when the decimal field returned by Trino/presto contains spaces
